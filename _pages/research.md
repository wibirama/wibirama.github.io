Our research interests span from developing an interactive user interface with eye tracking to using eye tracker as a diagnostic tool for various biomedical and usability issues. We are working on developing an intelligent touchless technology based on artificial intelligence and eye tracking sensor. This technology is promising for public health education and prevention of Covid-19. Our latest research interest has been implementing deep learning technology for various gaze-based applications such as:
- Spontaneous gaze-based interaction.
- Predicting cognitive style of online learners through visual attention.
- Visual saliency model for optimizing user experience of web.

We are working on a government-sponsored research project that explores possibilities of replacing old-fashioned eye movements classification methods with modern architectures of deep neural networks such as BiLSTM, Temporal Convolutional Networks, and so forth. We also have keen interest on optimizing deep neural networks architecture in gaze-based applications with various techniques such as pruning, hyperparameters optimization, knowledge distillation, and neural architecute search. Our focuses are not only performance of algorithm, but also minimizing carbon footprint of the developed technology. Our final goal will be developing robust gaze-based applications that are powered by eco-friendly deep learning technology.
